# GAB2017-Demo2
Just a simple ASP.Net MVC *Core* Web API demo for the Global Azure Bootcamp 2017.

Requires Visual Studio 2017 and Docker for Windows to run correctly locally.

This will build and allow you to deploy a container image with a 1.0 tag.

Note: the Edge release of Docker for Windows has issues at present with this setup (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43194968/visual-studio-2017-docker-error-running-app). 

If you experience this downgrade your Docker for Windows.
